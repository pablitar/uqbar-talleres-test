== Description ==

BadgeOS achievements and badges earned from a wide array of Tutor learning management system activity.

The "BadgeOS Tutor LMS Add-on" allows learners to earn achievements and badges from virtually every course, lesson and quiz activity available in the Tutor learning management system. When activated, BadgeOS admins will see a new "TutorLMS Activity" menu in their "Required Steps" manager when editing or creating any achievement or badge.

**Note:** You will need to install the free [BadgeOS plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/badgeos/ "BadgeOS")&trade; (version 1.2 or higher) to use the BadgeOS Tutor LMS Add-on. You will also need the [Tutor LMS plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tutor/ "Tutor LMS") v1.6.9 or higher installed, available from wordpress.org.

[Get the BadgeOS plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/badgeos/ "BadgeOS").

[BadgeOS](http://badgeos.org "BadgeOS")&trade; turns your WordPress site into an achievement and badging system. And with Tutor LMS enabled on your site, badges are not only awarded by activities such as making submissions, earning points, completing required achievements, and making site and community contributions, but also by completing Tutor LMS courses, lessons and quizzes. Define the achievements, organize the badge requirements any way you like, and choose from and combine a range of BadgeOS and Tutor LMS activity options to determine whether each task or requirement has been achieved.


**New ways to define achievements and give badges for Tutor LMS activity**

In addition to all of the out-of-the-box features in BadgeOS core, the BadgeOS Tutor LMS Add-on allows you to award achievements and badges based on these additional triggers:

*   **Quizzes:**
   *   Passed any Quiz
   *   Passed a specific Quiz
   *   Passed any Quiz of a course
   *   Failed any Quiz
   *   Failed a specific Quiz
   *   Failed any Quiz of a course
   *   Minimum % Grade on a Quiz

*   **Lessons:**
   *   Completed any Lesson
   *   Completed a specific Lesson
   *   Completed any Lesson of a course

*   **Courses:**
   *   Completed Course
   *   Completed a specific Course
   *   Completed Course from a Tag
   *   Subscribe in a course
   *   subscribe in a specific course



**Combine Tutor LMS Steps with BadgeOS Steps in Defining Achievements**

*   Simple interface for defining the "Required Steps" for any badge or achievement seamlessly integrates Tutor LMS actions
*   Easily define achievements that rely on both BadgeOS required steps and Tutor LMS actions
*   Easily link together one or more triggers, steps or actions into the conditions needed to earn any badge or mark an achievement.


**Display Badges on User Profiles with Free Community Add-on **

*   Activate the free "[BadgeOS Community Add-On](http://wordpress.org/plugins/badgeos-community-add-on/ "BadgeOS Community Add-on")" and "[BuddyPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/ "BuddyPress")" plugins to add a range of user community functions, including the ability to display earned badges and achievements on user profiles for others to see.
